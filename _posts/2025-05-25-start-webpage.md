title: New website

First post on my new website! The first version of my webpage was coded from scratch using HTML and CSS (and tiny bits of JS for MathJax etc.). However, I quickly realized that it was cumbersome to write everything in HTML, and make the site prettier and more user-friendly using CSS tricks.

Then, I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which allows you to generate websites from Markdown files, among other things. This was very appealing for me, as I already take notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for my PhD research (and MSc before that). 

There are many so-called themes for Jekyll websites, and many of them can be used for free!
